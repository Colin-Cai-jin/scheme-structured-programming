# Structured programming
It supports structured programming by 3 diffrent ways which are written in Scheme macro. So it has 3 DSLs(Domain-Specific Language) of Scheme.  

# Directories and files
It also supports Chez Scheme and Racket which directory `chez` is for Chez Scheme support, and directory `racket` is for Racket support. There are also two directories in `chez` and `racket` and their names are `src` and `examples`.  
`src` is the DSL support. `for-while-continue-break.ss` or `for-while-continue-break.rkt` is just a macro which supports for/while/continue/break. `structured-program.ss` or `structured-program.rkt` is a DSL which supports for/while/continue/break/goto, but it also uses prefix expressions like Scheme. `structured-program-infix.ss` or `structured-program-infix.rkt` is based on `structured-program`, but it uses infix expressions.  
`examples` is the directory of the examples.
